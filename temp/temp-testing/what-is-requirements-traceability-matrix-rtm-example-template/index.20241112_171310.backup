            <h1>Why Testing and Traceability Matter in Software Development</h1>
            <p>Testing ensures that our application functions as expected, providing confidence in its performance. Traceability – the ability to map requirements to test cases – is the cornerstone of an effective testing strategy.</p>

            <h2>Test Traceability</h2>
            <p>Test traceability refers to the ability to connect each test case to a specific requirement, ensuring that the application behaves as expected.</p>
            <p>Why is this important? As applications grow in complexity, maintaining traceability becomes crucial to ensure quality across multiple teams and versions of a product. Spreadsheets may suffice for small projects, but larger applications demand sophisticated test management tools for automated testing, unit tests, and UI-driven tests.</p>
            <h3>Benefits of Test Traceability</h3>
            <ul>
                <li id="forward-traceability">
                    <strong>Forward Traceability:</strong> Linking requirements to test cases helps product owners plan new features and validate functionality.
                </li>
                <li id="backward-traceability">
                    <strong>Backward Traceability:</strong> Mapping test cases back to requirements aids in diagnosing issues and generating detailed bug reports, improving developer understanding.
                </li>
                <li id="enhancement">
                    <strong>Enhancement:</strong> When adding new features, test coverage can be expanded to accommodate changes, ensuring robust functionality.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although 100% traceability is impractical, having a clear testing strategy that links functionality to test cases enhances development efficiency and builds confidence in your releases.</p>

        <section id="traceability-matrix">
            <h2>What is Traceability Matrix? (TM)</h2>
            <p>A Traceability Matrix is a document that maps and co-relates requirements with test cases. It provides a many-to-many relationship to ensure completeness and traceability.</p>
            <p>This matrix helps track requirements and ensures that all project needs are met during testing.</p>

        <section id="parameters-in-rtm">
            <h2>Parameters in Requirement Traceability Matrix</h2>
            <p>Key components of an RTM include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirement ID:</strong> Unique identifier for each requirement.</li>
                <li><strong>Requirement Type and Description:</strong> Explains the requirement in detail.</li>
                <li><strong>Test Cases with Status:</strong> Links each requirement to relevant test cases and their execution status.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In practice, a typical RTM might include additional parameters such as priority, risk level, or team responsibility.</p>

            <h2>How to Create a Requirement Traceability Matrix</h2>
            <p>Creating an RTM involves the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Business Requirement Document (BRD):</strong> This document outlines high-level business objectives and goals. For example, a BRD might state that a banking app must support transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Requirement Document (TRD):</strong> This document details technical specifications derived from the BRD. For example, the TRD might specify that the deposit feature requires integration with a backend API for transaction logging.</li>
                <li><strong>Test Cases:</strong> Write test cases for each requirement. For instance, a test case for the deposit feature might involve verifying successful deposits and handling edge cases like invalid amounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Execution Status:</strong> Track the execution status (e.g., "Passed," "Failed," or "Pending") of each test case in the RTM.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For instance, in the banking project, testers create test cases based on the BRD and TRD and ensure traceability throughout the testing lifecycle.</p>
