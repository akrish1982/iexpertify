<h1>What is Unstructured Data?</h1>

Unstructured data refers to information that does not have a predefined data model or cannot be easily organized into relational tables. It can be broadly classified into two types: non-textual unstructured data, such as still images, videos, and MP3 audio files, and textual unstructured data, like email messages, instant messages, and Excel files.

The objective of this presentation is to demonstrate how to design a Datastage job that extracts data from an Excel file with multiple sheets and writes it into a text file or comma-separated file.

<h2>When to Use Unstructured Data?</h2>

You may wonder why we can't use the sequential file stage to read an Excel file. Of course, we can use this stage to read data in an Excel file, but only if the sheet contains data in a single sheet. If the data is spread across multiple sheets, we simply cannot use the sequential stage.

The beauty of Unstructured Data stage lies in its additional transformations that allow us to pull out data from the entire worksheet. These transformations can be extended to include options like comments and authors in our output file.

<h2>Implementation in Datastage</h2>

To implement Unstructured Data in Datastage, you can find this stage under the Files section palette in the designer. Data can be read from or written to any sources.

<h3>Step-by-Step Process:</h3>

1. Drag an Unstructured Data stage and a dataset stage to the canvas and link them with a copy stage.
2. The source file is an Excel sheet with employee details in two different worksheets, "Employee.xlsx".
3. Define the properties to extract data from the Unstructured Data stage.

<h4>Properties:</h4>

* Give the path of the source file in the File name field.
* In the Range expression field, specify the range of data in the worksheet.
* Use the Skip sheet names option to skip sheets that are not required.
* Click on the Load button to import metadata and map it to the target file (DataSet).

<h3>Step 2: Copy Stage</h3>

Use a copy stage connected to the Unstructured Data stage to drop columns if not needed and map them to the target file (DataSet).

<h3>Step 3: Load Data into Target DataSet</h3>

Load data into the target dataset.

<h1>Output:</h1>

The employee information from two sheets is merged into one sheet in the output as below. This process can be primarily used when processing organizational/enterprise data that is used for calculating metrics and joining data from multiple sheets for reporting purposes.
<h1>Data Warehousing: Excel Data in DataStage - Unstructured Data</h1>
<p>Data warehousing is a process that involves collecting, integrating, and processing large amounts of data from various sources to support business intelligence and analytics. In this article, we will explore how to load unstructured Excel data into DataStage for further analysis.</p>
<h2>What is Unstructured Data?</h2>
<p>Unstructured data refers to data that does not fit into a predetermined format or structure, such as text files, images, audio files, and videos. In the context of data warehousing, unstructured data can include reports, spreadsheets, and other types of documents that contain valuable information for analysis.</p>
<h2>Challenges in Loading Unstructured Data</h2>
<p>Loading unstructured data into a data warehouse like DataStage can be challenging due to the lack of predefined structures or formats. However, with the right tools and techniques, you can successfully load and integrate this type of data into your analytics workflow.</p>
<h3>Using Excel as a Source</h3>
<p>Excel is a popular tool for storing and manipulating unstructured data. To load Excel data into DataStage, you can use the Excel OLEDB provider to connect to the file.</p>
<code>
    &lt;-- Define the Excel connection --&gt;
    &lt;oledb:connection name="ExcelConn" 
       driver="Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0"
       data-source="C:\Path\To\Your\File.xlsx"
       credentials-id="YourCredentialsId" /&gt;
  
    &lt;-- Define the Excel query --&gt;
    &lt;oledb:query name="ExcelQuery" 
       connection-name="ExcelConn"
       command-text="SELECT * FROM [Sheet1$A1:B10]" /&gt;
  </code>
<h3>Using DataStage to Load Unstructured Data</h3>
<p>DataStage provides a range of tools and techniques for loading unstructured data. One approach is to use the "File" node in DataStage to read the Excel file, and then transform the data using nodes like "Excel" or "Text File". Here's an example:</p>
<code>
    &lt;-- Define the File node --&gt;
    &lt;file:node name="FileNode" 
       filename="C:\Path\To\Your\File.xlsx"
       format="Excel"
       /&gt;
  
    &lt;-- Define the Excel transformation node --&gt;
    &lt;excel:node name="ExcelTransform" 
       connection-name="ExcelConn"
       query-name="ExcelQuery"
       /&gt;
  </code>
<h2>Benefits of Loading Unstructured Data</h2>
<p>Loading unstructured data into a data warehouse like DataStage can provide several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data integration**: By loading unstructured data into a centralized repository, you can integrate it with other data sources and create a single source of truth for analytics.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improved decision-making**: With structured and unstructured data integrated in a data warehouse, you can gain new insights and make more informed decisions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased scalability**: DataStage provides the scalability to handle large volumes of data from various sources, making it an ideal platform for big data analytics.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Loading unstructured Excel data into DataStage can be a powerful way to integrate and analyze unstructured data in your analytics workflow. By using the Excel OLEDB provider and DataStage nodes, you can transform and load this type of data into a centralized repository for further analysis.</p>
