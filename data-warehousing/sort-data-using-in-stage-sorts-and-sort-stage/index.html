Sort data using in-stage sorts and Sort stage - Data Warehousing Data Warehousing


<p>In several processing stages, we can choose or set the sort criteria (i.e. an link or “in-stage” sort).  When you do that, one of those tiny “Sort” icons show up the metadata link.</p>

<p>So, you know that the data is being sorted between stages.  So you may be wondering, why there is a separate Sort stage even offered, and why would I ever need to use it?</p>
<p>For link sort, you can’t control how much memory is allocated, I think the default is 20MB; in the Sort stage, you can specify how much memory to use.</p>
<p>“Link Sort” uses scratch disk (physical location on disk), whereas “Sort Stage” uses server RAM (Memory). Hence we can change the default memory size in “Sort Stage”.</p>

<p>The Sort stage will tell OSH that the stream was previously sorted on a column(s), and also to not sort on that column(s) but to sort on an additional column(s) e.g. the stream is already sorted on Columns A and B (but not C), so you can specify that the key to sort on is A, B and C, but A and B were previously sorted, thus, only sort on column C.</p>

<p>In other words, if your job is having performance issues and you’ve narrowed the problem to sorting, many of the problems can be addressed by a separate Sort stage.</p>
<p>If the volume of the data is low, then we go for link sort. If the volume of the data is high, then we go for sort stage.</p>
<p>For an implicit sort: over the years, DataStage has gotten smart enough to insert a sort into OSH when it wasn’t specified in the code.  </p>
<p>For instance, you want to aggregate on column A, but the job didn’t specify to sort the data on column A before the Aggregator, so, DataStage will implicitly include/insert a sort in your OSH.</p>
