Reading Time:  2 minutes

<p>The Join stage is a processing stage. It performs joinoperations on two or more data sets input to the stage and then outputs theresulting data set.</p>
<p>TheJoin stage is one of three stages that join tables based on the values of keycolumns.</p>
<p>Thethree stages differ mainly in the memory they use, the treatment of rows withunmatched keys, and their requirements for data being input.</p>
<p>Inthe Join stage, the input data sets are notionally identified as the“right” set and the “left” set.</p>
<p>Ithas any number of input links and a single output link.</p>
<p>Thedata sets input to the Join stage must be key partitioned and sorted inascending order.</p>
<p>Thisensures that rows with the same key column values are located in the samepartition and will be processed by the same node.Thestage can perform one of four join operations:</p>
<p>Inner It joins two or moretables and returns only those records which satisfy join condition. Recordswhose key columns do not contain equal values are dropped.</p>
<p>Leftouter transfersall values from the left data set but transfers values from the right data setand intermediate data sets only where key columns match. The stage drops thekey column from the right and intermediate data sets. puts NULL whereverunmatched record from 2nd (Right) table.</p>
<p>Rightouter transfersall values from the right data set and transfers values from the left data setand intermediate data sets only where key columns match. The stage drops thekey column from the left and intermediate data sets. puts NULL whereverunmatched record from 2nd (Left) table.</p>
<p>Fullouter  Itjoins two or more tables and returns both matched and unmatched records fromall tables. (Full outer joins do not support more than two input links.)</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<p>JoinKeys/Key – Type: Input Column</p>
<p>Nameof input column you want to join on. Columns with the same name must appear inboth input data sets and have compatible data types.</p>
<p>JoinType – Type of join operation to perform</p>
