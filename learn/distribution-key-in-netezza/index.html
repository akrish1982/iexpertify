<h1>Learn: Distribution Key in Netezza</h1>
<h2>Distribution, Not Just for Joins</h2>
<p>There are several other scenarios where data needs to be distributed to process.</p>
<p>First one that comes to mind are count distincts. Take for example a count of distinct users or customers like `count(distinct customer_id)` perhaps when doing analysis on purchase transactions. An example sql might be</p>
<pre><code>select count(distinct customer_id) from purchase_transaction</code></pre>
<p>For argument we'll say that purchase_transaction has random distribution. So Netezza has to break up the job. It can't just count distinct on every spu because you can't just add up the numbers at the end because some customers might be on more than one spu. The way to make it where you can just add them up is to make sure a customer can't be on more than one spu, and that means you need the data distributed by customer. That's exactly what the query plan will do, redistribute on customer. But of course if they data is already distributed on customer, then you save having to do a redistribution.</p>

<h2>What is a Distribution Key?</h2>
<p>In Netezza, a distribution key is a column or combination of columns that determines how data is distributed across the nodes of an appliance. It plays a crucial role in optimizing query performance by minimizing inter-node communication.</p>
</section>
<section id="benefits-of-distribution-key">
<h2>Benefits of Using a Distribution Key</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved query performance: By distributing data based on the distribution key, Netezza can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred between nodes, resulting in faster query execution.</li>
<li>Simplified data management: A well-chosen distribution key helps to balance data evenly across all nodes, making it easier to manage and maintain your data warehouse.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="choosing-the-right-distribution-key">
<h2>Choosing the Right Distribution Key</h2>
<p>To choose the right distribution key for your Netezza appliance, consider the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data usage patterns**: Identify the columns that are frequently used in your queries. These are likely to be good candidates for the distribution key.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data cardinality**: Choose a column or combination of columns with low cardinality (i.e., many unique values) to ensure efficient data distribution.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data correlation**: Consider columns that are highly correlated with each other, as they may benefit from being stored together on the same node.</strong></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="best-practices-for-distribution-key">
<h2>Best Practices for Distribution Key</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it simple**: Use a single column or a small combination of columns as the distribution key to minimize complexity.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use meaningful data**: Choose columns that have meaningful values, such as dates or IDs, rather than arbitrary columns like auto-generated keys.</strong></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-distribution-key">
<h2>Example Distribution Key</h2>
<p>In this example, we'll create a distribution key for an e-commerce database that tracks customer orders. We'll use the `customer_id` column as our distribution key:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id int,
  customer_id int,
  order_date date,
  ...
) WITH (DISTRIBUTION_KEY = 'customer_id');</code></pre>
