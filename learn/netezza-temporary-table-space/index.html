Netezza Temporary Table Space -


<p>In IBM PureData System for Analytics, each disk is roughly equally divided into 3 partitions:1. The first partition holds the primary copy of one dataslice2. The second partition holds a mirror copy of a dataslice from a different disk.3. The temp partition is used to store data that is generated during query execution. Temporary tables, intermediary results, etc.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ When we use temporary tables, it is this third partition, the temp space, that we risk filling up.‚Ä¢ It is important to only create the minimum number of temporary tables needed at a time. It is also important to only make the temporary tables as large as needed.‚Ä¢ Temporary tables are local to a session rather than a specific query. This means that the table may be used repeatedly within a user session. That is the major difference between Temporary tables (multiple use) and derived tables (single use). A Temporary table is materialized in swap space. However, it is not discarded until the session ends or when the user manually drops it.</p>
Storage layers
<p>When explicitly creating large temporary tables used in JOINs it is recommended to GENERATE STATISTICS on the temporary table.</p>
