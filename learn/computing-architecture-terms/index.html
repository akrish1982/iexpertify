Computing Architecture terms - learn





<p>Process — an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It has its own set of resources (e.g. memory) that are not shared with other processes.</p>
<p>Thread — a process may run multiple threads to perform instructions in parallel. Threads within a process share resources (e.g. memory).</p>
<p>Server — a program running to serve the requests of other programs. The term is also used to refer to a physical computer dedicated to run one or more services.</p>
<p>Multi-Process — adding more throughput by running multiple instances of a process or service. These can be on a single server or can be distributed across multiple servers.</p>
<p>Multi-Threaded — within a process, being able to perform multiple tasks simultaneously across multiple CPUs.</p>
<p>Scalability — scalability is about supporting multiple simultaneous actions, not about making a single action faster.</p>
<p>Availability — the ability of a solution to be resistant to component failures. Increasing the availability of a solution will increase the cost.</p>
Scale Up vs Scale Out
<p>Scale Up — adding more resources (CPU, RAM, etc) to a single server.</p>
<p>Scale Out — adding more resources (CPU, RAM, etc) by adding more servers in a “cluster”.</p>
<p>Single Point of Failure – within a solution, a component that if it fails will cause the solution to fail as a whole. </p>
<p>Active/Active – when all instances of a multi-process service will process requests. </p>
<p>Active/Passive – when only some instances of a multi- process service will process requests and the other instances are only activated in the event of a component failure. Hardware Architecture Terminology</p>
