**1. Introduction to Apache Cassandra**

Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. It's a great choice for managing big data applications where requirements include linear scalability, high performance, and fault tolerance on commodity hardware.

---

**2. Installation and Setup**

In this section, we will walk you through the installation process of Apache Cassandra on various platforms like Windows, Linux, and MacOS. We'll also cover essential setup configurations to get your first Cassandra cluster up and running.

---

**3. Data Modeling in Cassandra**

Learn how to model data effectively in Cassandra by understanding keyspaces, tables, and column families. This section will provide best practices for optimizing data storage and retrieval performance.

---

**4. Cassandra Query Language (CQL)**

Master the basics of CQL, which allows you to query, manipulate, and interact with your Apache Cassandra database efficiently. We'll cover essential CQL commands, functions, and data types to help you get started.

---

**5. Performance Tuning and Best Practices**

Optimize your Apache Cassandra performance by implementing best practices for cluster configuration, data modeling, and query optimization. This section will provide actionable tips to ensure your database runs smoothly under high load.

---

**6. Scaling and Replication**

Explore how to scale Apache Cassandra horizontally across multiple nodes and configure replication for high availability and fault tolerance. This section will cover strategies for handling massive data growth and maintaining strong performance.

---

**7. Backups and Disaster Recovery**

Learn about various backup solutions for Apache Cassandra, including snapshotting and streaming backups. We'll also discuss disaster recovery strategies to ensure your data is protected from unexpected events.

---

**8. Monitoring and Maintenance**

Monitor your Apache Cassandra cluster effectively using popular tools like OpsCenter, JMX, and the native CLI tool "cassandra-stress". This section will teach you how to maintain your cluster and troubleshoot common issues when they arise.

---

**9. Use Cases and Real-World Examples**

Understand the real-world applications of Apache Cassandra by exploring various use cases, such as managing social media data, time-series data, IoT device data, and more. We'll provide practical examples to help you visualize the power of this versatile database system.
