Netezza CREATEXID DELETEXID


<p>Note: TRUNCATING TABLE cannot be UNDONE</p>
<p>Note: Netezza “soft” deletes until the groom process runs.  i.e. deleted data is really still there.  </p>
<p>Note: Netezza Updates are just soft deletes and inserts. So, they can be recovered too</p>
<ul>
<li>Every insert, update, or delete transaction is assigned a sequential transaction id or xid.</li>
<li>To indicate which transaction last updated the row, createxid indicates the latest transaction for each row</li>
<li>To indicate deleted rows deletexid, assigned to each row is set to 0 if this is a readable (not a deleted row).  When the row gets deleted, this column gets populated with the transaction id assigned to the delete or update statement</li>
<li>Updates are essentially deletes that set the transaction id as deletexid to old row and createxid in the new row</li>
<li>Groom would make the soft deletes final</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, when you run a select you will not see rows that have a deletexid not equal to zero.  To change that, set the below option</p>

set show_deleted_records = true

<h2>How to restore Netezza records</h2>
<p>Here is a simple select statement:</p>
select createxid,deletexid, * from table

Netezza Createxid and Deletexid
<p>If you want to see just the deleted rows , just select where deletexid is not zero</p>
select createxid,deletexid, * from table where deletexid !=0
<p>Once you can see your deleted data, and figure out which transaction you are trying to undo, you can simply re-insert the data</p>
insert into table
select * from table where deletexid=142233; –transaction id from delete.
<p>To undo an update, just re-insert the deleted rows and delete the inserted rows.</p>
insert into table 
select * from table where deletexid=146443 ;–transaction id from update
delete from table where createxid=146443; –transaction id from update
<p>To undo an insert, use the below SQL</p>
delete from table where createxid=1434443; –transaction id from insert
<p></p>
