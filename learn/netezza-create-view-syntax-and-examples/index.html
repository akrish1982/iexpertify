Netezza Create View Syntax - learn
Reading Time:  &lt; 1 minute
<p>Utilize the create view statement to create a virtual table based on the result-set of a complex SQL statement that may have multiple table joins or a simple SELECT statement with selected columns that are needed to be viewed by the analyst group. Netezza Views are read-only. The system does not allow you an insert, update, or delete on a view.</p>
Netezza Create View Syntax
<p>Syntax for creating a view:</p>
CREATE &lt;OR REPLACE&gt; VIEW &lt;view_name&gt; AS SELECT &lt;query&gt;;

<p>Other databases like Teradata supports creating RECURSIVE VIEW but Netezza does not supports RECURSIVE view creation,</p>
<p>Netezza check View if it is not obsolete</p>
<p>If you alter or change the underlying view table then that view will become obsolete and not usable until you re-compile that. IBM has provided the script that will allow you to check if view is obsolete. Generally, script is available at /nz/support/bin location. Ask your Netezza admin team for exact location. Below is the script and its usage:</p>
nz_check_views [ database ] [-replace &lt;flag&gt;]
